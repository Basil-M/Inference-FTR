# Bayesian and non-bayesian logistic classifiers
_Third year coursework for module 3F8: Inference. Coursework involved developing both a non-Bayesian and a Bayesian probabilistic logistic classifier, with and without the use of radial basis functions augmenting the data._

## Files
- `simple_logistic_classifier.py` contains code used to develop the non-bayesian logistic classifier used in the original coursework
- `predictor_bias.py` was used to evaluate how bias in the training data can effect the final regression fit
- `misc.py` contains miscellaneous functions - some where provided as part of the coursework, but all functions used to make the classifier probabilistic were self-developed.
- `ftr.py` contains code initially used to develop the bayesian logistic classifier
- `ftr_grid_search.py` performs a simple grid search to optimise hyper-parameters
- `gridfit.m` contains MATLAB code used to visualise some of the data produced by above functions
## Results
The results of this investigation are documented in [the report submitted](/Documents/Final_Report.pdf).
